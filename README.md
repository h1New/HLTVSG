The MATLAB code of the paper 'Hyperspectral Image Denoising Based on Hyper-Laplacian Total Variation in Spectral Gradient Domain'. If you use this code, please cite this [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10918724).



## 📝

A typesetting error was found in the published version of the paper:

- **In Equation (8) (Page 5)**:  
  The published version incorrectly formats the norm symbols `\left\|` and `\right\|`, causing inconsistent symbol scaling.  
  The correct version should be:

  $$
  \sum_{i=1}^2 \Vert{\mathcal{Z}}_i\Vert _{q_i}^{q_i} + \lambda \Vert{\mathcal{B}}\Vert _1 + \beta \sum _{b=1}^P \Vert{\mathbf{S}}_b\Vert _*
  $$

  **Impact**: This is purely a typesetting issue and does not affect any mathematical results or conclusions.
